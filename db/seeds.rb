The citizen-built election resource was updated earlier this month in preparation for this Saturday’s by-election. The site, originally built by Open Democracy Manitoba for the 2010 Winnipeg general election, continues to empower and educate local voters about the roles, issues, and visions of our representatives. \r\n\r\nThe WinnipegElection.ca website features interactive ward maps, ward statistics and historical information about past elections, along with profiles of the current council and school trustee candidates. Twenty-one of the twenty-five candidates running in the November 26th by-election have replied to the WinnipegElection.ca platform questionnaire. Candidate questionnaire responses are featured on the site, along with links to their web pages, email addresses, and social media accounts.\r\n\r\nCivic by-elections are typically plagued by low voter turn-out. In response to this challenge, the members of Open Democracy Manitoba are running a social-media campaign on Twitter and Facebook, spreading information about this by-election in hopes of increasing voter turnout.\r\n\r\n**Candidates and Voters Embrace Winnipeg Election Website** - [October 18, 2010](/press/WinnipegElectionCa_Oct_18_2010_final.pdf) ![pdf](/images/pdf.png)\r\n\r\nWinnipegElection.ca is pleased to announce its continued success in providing the citizens of Winnipeg with a useful resource for making informed decisions about the October 2010 civic election. Traffic on the website is at an all time high and the response to their all candidate questionnaire is exceeding\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\n\"We're excited to see such engagement by candidates\" says Jody Gillis, one of the founders of the site. \"Over sixty-four candidates have replied to our questionnaire and this number is growing daily.\"\r\n\r\nWith 150,000+ page views and 15,000+ unique visitors, the locally developed website is growing rapidly by accumulating accurate and up-to-date information about the upcoming election. \"These stats tell us that voters are eager to research their candidates online.\" says co-founder Kyle Geske. \"With only nine days until the election, we’re expecting an acceleration of activity.\"\r\n\r\n**Citizen Created Election Website Attracts Attention** - [September 23, 2010](/press/WinnipegElectionCaAttractsAttention-final.pdf) ![pdf](/images/pdf.png)\r\n\r\nFrustrated by the lack of information about their local candidates during the 2006 Winnipeg civic election, city residents and cousins Kyle Geske and Jody Gillis decided to build an online election resource for their fellow citizens. Geske and Gillis, instructors at Red River College, spent a large part of their spare time during the past two months working on a website for the upcoming Winnipeg civic election. Their work has paid off. Their WinnipegElection.ca website has become a recognized source of information for this October’s election.\r\n\r\n\"We are concerned about voter apathy,\" says Geske when asked about site goals. \"We believe that open and accessible information fosters interest. The strength of our government depends on informed voters.\"\r\n\r\nThe site features interactive ward maps, ward statistics, historical information about past elections, and a calendar of election related events. Candidates are listed along with links to their web pages, email addresses, Facebook fan pages and Twitter feeds. News articles that mention candidates are also linked providing up to date information from a variety of media sources.\r\n\r\nAs the site grows in popularity, it’s not just citizens who are taking notice. \"We have city council and mayoral hopefuls contacting us to provide their photos and social media links,\" says Gillis. \"Engaging citizens online evens the playing field for all candidates.\" \r\n\r\nNow that nominations have been finalized, Geske is working on adding a school trustee section to the site.

  {title: "The Role of a City Councillor", content: "Council is the governing body of the City and the custodian of its powers, both legislative and administrative. The City may exercise only those powers granted to it by legislation. \r\n\r\nPolicy making at the local level is limited and controlled by provincial government statute. [The City of Winnipeg Charter](http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/2002/c03902e.php) provides the majority of powers and authority to the City of Winnipeg. However, other statutes extend additional authority to City Council in its decision making process.\r\n\r\nThe composition of City Council is legislated under Part 3 of [The City of Winnipeg Charter](http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/2002/c03902e.php) and consists of 15 Councillors and the Mayor. Each Councillor represents an individual ward while the Mayor is elected by a vote of the city-at-large.\r\n\r\nCouncillors have a dual role, as they are members of Council (decisions affecting the whole city) and members of the Community Committees (local community issues).\r\n\r\nCity Council exercises its powers either by by-law or resolution passed at a regular or special meeting when a quorum is present. Pursuant to the Charter, Council has the authority to establish committees of Council and Council may, by by-law delegate a power, duty or function to a committee of Council.\r\n\r\nThe authority to make final decisions on the following matters remains with Council and cannot be delegated to any political or administrative level below Council: \r\n\r\n* authority to enact a by-law;\r\n* authority to approve an operating or capital budget;\r\n* authority to appoint, suspend or dismiss a statutory officer; or\r\n* authority to enter into a collective agreement in respect of employees;\r\n\r\nSource: [City of Winnipeg Municipal Manual](http://www.winnipeg.ca/clerks/pdfs/2013MunicipalManual.pdf) ![pdf](/images/pdf.png \"pdf\")\r\n", permalink: "role-of-a-city-councillor", show_title: true},
  {title: "The Role of a School Trustee", content: "The main functions of a school trustee include preparing for and participating in school board and committee meetings. Each school division has a school board made of school trustees. Policy is determined at public school board meetings and sets the direction for the school division.\r\n\r\nSchool Trustees also attend meetings of the committees on which they serve. Most school boards have a number of committees that deal with areas such as finance, personnel, curriculum, and facilities. Other committees can be formed to deal with special projects or emerging issues. These committees create reports that generally go to the school board before being passed as policy.\r\n\r\nSource: [2011 Civic Election School Trustee Guide](http://www.winnipeg.ca/clerks/docs/elections/2011ByElection/pdfs/SchoolTrusteeInfo.pdf) ![pdf](/images/pdf.png \"pdf\")", permalink: "role-of-a-school-trustee", show_title: true}
